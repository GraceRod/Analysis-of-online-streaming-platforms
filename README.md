# Analysis-of-online-streaming-platforms
Everyone loves watching a good movie or TV show during their free time to relax and unwind. And there are various online streaming platform services where thousands of TV shows and movies are available. Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+ are major online streaming services available across the world. There are a variety of TV shows and movies available for us to watch on these platforms, albeit at a subscription cost.

Different people have different priorities based on which they choose a streaming platform to subscribe to. For some, the genres available may play a huge role in deciding which platform to use, for others it may be the languages the movies are available in. What if you have young children and want to watch something that is suitable for them? Or maybe youâ€™re in university and want to watch something suitable for your age group. Or you just watching love animated films. Which of the streaming platform is best suited to your needs?

The aim of this project is to analyse the types of movies available on the four online streaming platforms, Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+, and decide which one is the best option to subscribe to. In the given data, there are several features available such as the directors of the movie, genre, etc. In this work, we focus on the ages, ratings, and genres available on the four streaming platforms.
